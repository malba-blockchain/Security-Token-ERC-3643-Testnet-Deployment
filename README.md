## Introduction

The **Raptor Version of ERC-3643** . Is a respectful nod to the [**T-Rex (ERC-3643) standard**](https://github.com/TokenySolutions/T-REX/), developed by [@TokenySolutions](https://github.com/TokenySolutions).

The Raptor version, created by Adam Boudj [@Aboudjem](https://github.com/Aboudjem) isn't about competition with T-Rex, it's about sharing knowledge and making it easier for everyone to understand this great piece of technology. ðŸ§©

You can check the [Original Raptor Version here](https://github.com/Aboudjem/ERC-3643).

## Testnet version

The tesnet version is a deployment created to work on any EVM compatible blockchain.

This specific version is deployed on the Amoy Polygon Testnet. Which represents an environment extremely simmilar to the mainnet version.

## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v18.17)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Quickstart

To get started with Scaffold-ETH 2, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repo & install dependencies

```
git clone https://github.com/malba-blockchain/Security-Token-ERC-3643-Testnet-Deployment.git
cd Security-Token-ERC-3643-Testnet-Deployment
yarn install

```

2. Ensure to clean and recompile smart contracts:

```
yarn hardhat clean
yarn compile --force
```

3. Create a .env file in the folder "packages\hardhat", filling the following fields:

```
REACT_APP_DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY= Private key of the wallet you want to use as deployer
REACT_APP_CLAIM_ISSUER_PRIVATE_KEY= Private key of the wallet you want to use as claim issuer
REACT_APP_ISSUER_AGENT_ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY= Using a single wallet for three roles (issuer, agent and admin)
REACT_APP_ADAM_PRIVATE_KEY= Private key of the first user
REACT_APP_BOB_PRIVATE_KEY= Private key of the second user
REACT_APP_CHARLIE_PRIVATE_KEY= Private key of the third user
REACT_APP_ALCHEMY_API_KEY= Get your APY_KEY by creating an account on https://auth.alchemy.com/
REACT_APP_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY= Get your API_KEY by creating an account on https://polygonscan.com/login
```

4. Make sure to get MATIC to pay for deplyment of smart contracts and transaction fees in all the wallets you have

```
https://faucet.polygon.technology/
https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/polygon-amoy 
```

MAKE SURE YOU GOT MATIC IN ALL YOUR WALLETS OR YOU WILL HAVE ISSUES DEPLOYING
MAKE SURE YOU GOT API KEYS FOR THE RIGHT NETWORK OR YOU WILL HAVE ISSUES DEPLOYING

5. Open a new terminal in the main folder and type the command:

```
yarn deploy --reset --network polygonAmoy
```

This command deploys the smart contracts to the test network.


**What's next**:

Verify your smart contracts using 2 main methods:

1. Via polygonscan https://amoy.polygonscan.com/verifyContract
Uploading the file generated by the command yarn hardhat flatten contracts/onchain-id/Identity.sol > flattened/Identity.sol

2. Via Hardhat using the command: yarn hardhat-verify --network polygonAmoy 0x4ec843f44d361b1bDCba588705c6E218965232da --constructor-args scripts/arguments_identity_registry.js
